# Example

This is an example of a markdown file.

## Heading 2

This is a link to [Google](https://www.google.com).

Inject actual html &mdash; the previous character is an emdash.

### Heading 3

Let's make a list.

* First element
    * Sub element
    * Now we are **bolding** things


Simple checklist 

- [ ] first things first
- [ ] next
- [ ] last

> This is a quote that I would like to highlight.

Code looks different.

```python
# python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

```

Finally, insert an image.
!['Logo from calex.org']['img/calex-logo.img']
